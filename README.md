## About

It's time for me to make another Fighting Game scoreboard project. This time, we go all out thanks to wails. 

## Run the program
Currently, you need to access the files in `build/bin`. open the scoreboard-overlay app and set the OBS by 
selecting Browser and look for the essential files to show. For now, there's:
1. scoreboard.html (your main scoreboard)
2. commentary.html (for commentary screen)
3. bracket_single (for single elimination brackets, ONLY supports Top 8 format)
4. bracket_double (for double elimination brackets, ONLY supports Top 8 format)
