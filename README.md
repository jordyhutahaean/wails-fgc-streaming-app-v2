A desktop app built with Wails
 for managing fighting game tournaments.
Easily control scoreboards, commentators, brackets, and sponsor logos, and use them directly in OBS through local overlays.

## Features:

- Scoreboard Control – Player names, teams, controllers, visibility, titlecards

- Commentary Overlay – Two-caster layout with names and roles

- Brackets – Single & Double Elimination visualization

- Sponsors – Auto-detect logos placed in /frontend/sponsors

- Auto JSON Save – All overlay data stored locally

- Built-in Local Web Server – Overlays served on http://localhost:34115

- Neo-Brutalist + Halftone UI – Clean, bold interface for production

## How to Use (for Users)

After downloading the ZIP:

Extract it anywhere

Run the app

It opens a desktop control panel

It starts a local server on http://localhost:34115

In OBS, add Browser Sources:

Overlay	URL
🏆 Scoreboard	http://localhost:34115/scoreboard.html
🎙 Commentary	http://localhost:34115/commentary.html
🔀 Single Elim	http://localhost:34115/single.html
🌀 Double Elim	http://localhost:34115/double.html

Set Width & Height in OBS as needed (e.g. 1280×720)

To show sponsors, place logo images inside the sponsors folder:

build/bin/sponsors/


They will automatically appear in rotation on overlays.

🧩 Folder Structure (Source)
frontend/
 ├── scoreboard.html     # Scoreboard overlay
 ├── commentary.html     # Commentary overlay
 ├── single.html         # Single elim bracket overlay
 ├── double.html         # Double elim bracket overlay
 └── sponsors/           # Sponsor logos (auto-detected)
app.go                   # App logic (scoreboard, commentary, brackets, sponsors)
main.go                  # Wails entry point + overlay webserver


## Requirements (for Developers)

To build or run from source, make sure you have:

Go 1.21+

Node.js 18+

Wails CLI

// Run in Development
wails dev


This launches:

the control panel app (desktop window)

the overlay web server at http://localhost:34115

You can test your overlays in a browser or in OBS.

// Build a Release Version
wails build


Your compiled app will be located in:

./build/bin/

Example Structure
build/bin/
 ├── Fighting Game Scoreboard Control.exe  (on Windows)
 ├── frontend/
 │   ├── scoreboard.html
 │   ├── commentary.html
 │   ├── single.html
 │   ├── double.html
 │   └── sponsors/
 └── sponsors/   # created automatically if not exists


When you run the .exe, it will automatically start the overlay webserver on port 34115.


//Sharing Your App

If you want to share your built version with other users:

Navigate to build/bin/

Zip the folder contents (include the .exe + frontend + sponsors)

Upload the ZIP to GitHub Releases (e.g. v1.0.0)

// Notes

Overlays are static HTML files served locally by the app

Data is written as JSON in /frontend (e.g. scoreboard.json)

sponsors.json is auto-generated when adding/deleting images

You can safely edit overlays' design if you know HTML/CSS

// Troubleshooting
Issue	Cause	Fix
 “Overlay not loading in OBS”	App isn’t running or port conflict	Make sure the app is open. Check if another app uses port 34115.
 “Sponsors not showing”	Folder is empty or wrong path	Place your images in build/bin/sponsors/ and restart the app.
 “Changes not appearing”	Cached overlay in OBS	Right-click browser source → Refresh, or restart OBS.
 “Firewall warning”	Windows blocking local server	Click “Allow access” when prompted.
 “Double-click does nothing”	Missing files or moved exe	Keep frontend folder next to .exe. Don’t move them separately.

💡 Tip: If you’re using a custom port, edit main.go → ListenAndServe(":34115") and rebuild.
